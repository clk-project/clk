When you get used to create groups of commands, you generally end up having a sequence that comes out quite naturally.

It is handy to have each command do one thing and do it well, while at the same time have a shortcut to chain them.

For the sake of the example, let's suppose you are writing a bunch of commands to perform 3d printing. Hereafter, the printing aspect will be mocked. Its only interest is to show one of my real life usages of clk.

You would first create the group of commands named `printer` like so.

```bash
clk command create python --group printer --description "This is a group of commands to deal with 3D printing."
```

Classically, with the end result in mind, you may start by writing the command that sends the final gcode to the printer.

```python
@printer.command()
@option("--gcode", help="The gcode file", default="model.gcode")
@flag("--warn-when-done", help="Trigger a notification when done")
@argument("printer", help="The ip of the printer to send the gcode to")
def send(gcode, warn_when_done, printer):
    """Send some gcode to your printer"""
    print(f"Printing {gcode} using {printer}")
    if warn_when_done:
        print("Driiiiiiing!")
```

In general, to get the gcode file that contains printer instruction, you first slice a 3D model, most likely in the format STL.

Let's create this command.

```python
@printer.command()
@option("--model", default=["model.stl"], help="The model to slice", multiple=True)
@option("--output", default="model.gcode", help="The file getting the final gcode")
def slice(model, output):
    """Slice a model"""
    print("Slicing " + ", ".join(model) + f" to {output}")
```

Now, we have a command that slices the 3D model to a gcode and one command to send the gcode instructions to the printer.

That is nice. And you can play with those two commands, until you realize that you also need to calibrate the printer before running the print. Let's create this calibrate command.

```python
@printer.command()
def calibrate():
    """Run everything that is needed to have the printer ready to print"""
    print("Running some stuff for the printer to be ready to go")
```

Great, we created three commands to play with our printer.

In most cases, we want to chain those commands in a so-called flow.

Let's define such a flow.

```python
from clk.overloads import get_command

@printer.flow_command(flowdepends=["printer.calibrate"])
@get_command("printer.slice").flow_option("model")
@get_command("printer.send").flow_option("warn_when_done")
@get_command("printer.send").flow_argument("printer")
def flow(**kwargs):
    """Run the whole flow"""
    print("The flow is done")
```

Note that calibrate, slice and send don't have any precedence relationship between each other. By providing `flow_command`, `flow_option` and `flow_argument` in that order, we explicitly say to the command named flow that it should run them from top to bottom: calibrate, slice and then send.

The flow\_option and flow\_argument lines tell that this new command "captures" those parameters from the respective commands.

This new command can be called with `--model`, `--warn-when-done` and `--printer` and will eventually run `printer calibrate`, `printer slice` and then `printer send` with the appropriate parameters.

Note that we only defined explicitly the flow dependency to `printer calibrate`. The dependency to `printer slice` and `printer send` is implicitly known by the fact we captured some of their parameters.

Let's try to run the flow to get the feeling of how it is used.

```bash
clk printer flow myprinter --model somemodel --model someothermodel --warn-when-done
```

    Running some stuff for the printer to be ready to go
    Slicing somemodel, someothermodel to model.gcode
    Printing model.gcode using myprinter
    Driiiiiiing!
    The flow is done

# alternative use case, explicitly defining the flow

You might want to stick with those 3 commands and don't want to add the extra command `flow` to glue them together. This is doable by explicitly defining the flow in the definition of `@printer.command` on top of every commands.

Yet get something like this.

```python
@printer.command()
def calibrate():
    """Run everything that is needed to have the printer ready to print"""
    print("Running some stuff for the printer to be ready to go")

@printer.command(flowdepends=["printer.calibrate"])
@option("--model", default=["model.stl"], help="The model to slice", multiple=True)
@option("--output", default="model.gcode", help="The file getting the final gcode")
def slice(model, output):
    """Slice a model"""
    print("Slicing " + ", ".join(model) + f" to {output}")

@printer.command(flowdepends=["printer.slice"])
@option("--gcode", help="The gcode file", default="model.gcode")
@flag("--warn-when-done", help="Trigger a notification when done")
@argument("printer", help="The ip of the printer to send the gcode to")
def send(gcode, warn_when_done, printer):
    """Send some gcode to your printer"""
    print(f"Printing {gcode} using {printer}")
    if warn_when_done:
        print("Driiiiiiing!")
```

Now, you only have three commands and running the flow needs to be done explicitly.

```bash
echo "# Running the send command, without the flow"
clk printer send myprinter
echo "# Running the send command, asking for its flow"
clk printer send myprinter --flow
```

    # Running the send command, without the flow
    Printing model.gcode using myprinter
    # Running the send command, asking for its flow
    Running some stuff for the printer to be ready to go
    Slicing model.stl to model.gcode
    Printing model.gcode using myprinter

Doing so, there is no way to provide the parameters of the commands of the flow. If you want to provide a value for `--model` of `printer slice`, you will have to use parameters.

```bash
clk parameter set printer.slice --model someothermodel
clk printer send myprinter --flow
```

    New global parameters for printer.slice: --model someothermodel
    Running some stuff for the printer to be ready to go
    Slicing someothermodel to model.gcode
    Printing model.gcode using myprinter

Here, your mileage may vary. Choose the implementation that suits you better.

# when the flow is wrong

Let's assume you miss-typed the flow dependencies. Something like.

```python
@printer.command()
def calibrate():
    """Run everything that is needed to have the printer ready to print"""
    print("Running some stuff for the printer to be ready to go")

@printer.command(flowdepends=["printer.calib"])
@option("--model", default=["model.stl"], help="The model to slice", multiple=True)
@option("--output", default="model.gcode", help="The file getting the final gcode")
def slice(model, output):
    """Slice a model"""
    print("Slicing " + ", ".join(model) + f" to {output}")

@printer.command(flowdepends=["printer.slice"])
@option("--gcode", help="The gcode file", default="model.gcode")
@flag("--warn-when-done", help="Trigger a notification when done")
@argument("printer", help="The ip of the printer to send the gcode to")
def send(gcode, warn_when_done, printer):
    """Send some gcode to your printer"""
    print(f"Printing {gcode} using {printer}")
    if warn_when_done:
        print("Driiiiiiing!")
```

```bash
  clk command create python --force --group printer --description "This is a group of commands to deal with 3D printing." --body '
@printer.command()
def calibrate():
    """Run everything that is needed to have the printer ready to print"""
    print("Running some stuff for the printer to be ready to go")

@printer.command(flowdepends=["printer.calib"])
@option("--model", default=["model.stl"], help="The model to slice", multiple=True)
@option("--output", default="model.gcode", help="The file getting the final gcode")
def slice(model, output):
    """Slice a model"""
    print("Slicing " + ", ".join(model) + f" to {output}")

@printer.command(flowdepends=["printer.slice"])
@option("--gcode", help="The gcode file", default="model.gcode")
@flag("--warn-when-done", help="Trigger a notification when done")
@argument("printer", help="The ip of the printer to send the gcode to")
def send(gcode, warn_when_done, printer):
    """Send some gcode to your printer"""
    print(f"Printing {gcode} using {printer}")
    if warn_when_done:
        print("Driiiiiiing!")
'
```

When you run it, you will get the error

```bash
clk printer send --flow myprinter
```

    error: The flow of printer.slice could not be resolved. Command printer.calib not found
    error: The flow of printer.send could not be resolved. Command printer.calib not found
    Usage: clk printer send [OPTIONS] PRINTER
    error: No such option: --flow
    Hint: If you don't know where this option comes from, try checking the parameters (with clk --no-parameter parameters show).

Beware that this means that you have to check that this command it actually defined.
