Some times, you want to share some pieces of code in several bash commands.

You can put that code in another directory called lib sibling to the commands. Read [this use case](send_sms.md) for a more real life scenario.

Say you want to provide a function called shout that capitalize the input.

```bash
shout () {
   tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'
}
```

Let's put this code in a file called mylib.

```bash
  mkdir -p "${CLKCONFIGDIR}/bin/lib"
  cat<<EOF > "${CLKCONFIGDIR}/bin/lib/mylib"
shout () {
   tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'
}
EOF
```

Then you can simply import this code in your code, using clk\_import.

```bash
clk command create bash somecommand --no-open
cat <<"EOH" > "$(clk command which somecommand)"
#!/bin/bash -eu

source "_clk.sh"

clk_import mylib

clk_usage () {
    cat<<EOF
$0

This command does something
--

EOF
}

clk_help_handler "$@"

echo something | shout

EOH
```

```bash
test "$(clk somecommand)" = "SOMETHING"
```
