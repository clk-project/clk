# Lines to exclude from coverage analysis
# These are implementation details that don't represent meaningful test coverage differences
#
# Format:
#   filename:line_number           (no content check)
#   filename:line_number:content   (validates content matches before excluding)
#
# The expected_content is checked against the actual source to detect stale exclusions

# Argument parsing optimization path - taken when extra args don't need iteration

# Profile existence checks - incidental coverage differences
# Note: line numbers from coverage JSON may differ from local source by 1
